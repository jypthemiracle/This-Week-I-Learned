## OAuth2 Simplified

* OAuth2 is an authorization framework that enables applications to provide limited access according to user accounts.
* OAuth2 delegates user authentications to the service where the information of hosts have been stored, and authorizes third-party applications to access the user's content.
* Basically, OAuth2 provides authorization flows that enables web, desktop applications, and mobile devices to access the content specifically for users.
* The framework is expected to send ```access token``` as the prove of endowment of authority to third party application on behalf of the framework. The client has a right to decide whether the access or/and sevice request is valid or not.
* A server certifies the token to determine the validity of request, and sends the result to client. Since the token is entertained for authorization on behalf of session or cookie, the latter are not required to utilize the service from both of the client and server.

#### OAuth Roles

* OAuth defines the following rules:
  * Resource Owner
  * Client
  * Resource Server
  * Authorization Server
* Resource Owner: User
  * Resource Owner provides the authorization in just for protected resources.
  * The user who authorizeds an application to access their content is only limited to the scope that the authorization has been placed by the authorization server. (e.g. Read/Write only)
* Resource / Authorization Server: API
  * The resource server hosts the user accounts, and the other server verifies the identity of the user where the token is issued only in the case of turning it out to be valid.
* Client: Application
  * The client is the application that would like to utilize the user's account. The authorization should be validated by both user and the API.

#### Abstract Protocol Flow

![Abstract Protocol Flow](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/oauth/abstract_flow.png)

* The flow goes as the steps of the diagram are explained below:
  * The application requests the users for the authorization to access services resources.
  * The application receives authorization grant and requests an access token from the authorization server by presenting the identity of users in that only user grants the access.
  * If the application identity is authenticated and the authorization grant is valid, the authorization server issues an access token to the application. The finish of authorization.
  * The application requests the resource from the authorization server and presents the access token for authentication.
  * If the access token is valid, the resource server serves the resources to the application.

#### Authorization Code Flow

![Authorization Code Flow](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/oauth/auth_code_flow.png)

**Step 1: Authorization Code Link**

* Let us imagine the given authorization code is the following and analyze it.

```
https://lucas.codesquad.kr/v1/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=CALLBACK_URL&scope=read
```

* The API authorization endpoint: ```https://lucas.codesquad.kr/v1/oauth/authorize```
* The application's client ID that is utilized for identifying the application: ```client_id=CLIENT_ID```
* The service redirects the user-agent after and authorization code is granted: ```redirect_uri=CALLBACK_URL```
* The code that specifies your application has requested an authorization grant: ```response_type=code```
* The scope that specifies the level of access that the application is requesting: ```scope=read```

**Step 2: User Authorizes Application**

* Imagine the situation where the user clicks the link and an alert is prompted by the service that requests the user to allow the application to access their content.

**Step 3: Application Receives Authorization Code**

* The service redirects the user-agent to the application redirect URI which was specified during the client registration, along with an authorization code. It looks like the following link.

```
https://lucas.codesquad.kr/callback?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE
```

**Step 4: Application Requests Access Token**

* The application requests an access token from the API, by passing the authorization code along with authentication details, including the client secret, to the API token endpoint. It looks like..

```
https://lucas.codesquad.kr/v1/oauth/token?client_id=CLIENT_ID&client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET&grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&redirect_uri=CALLBACK_URL
```

**Step 5: Application Receives Access Token**

* If the authorization is valid, the API will send a response containing the access token to the application. The entire response may look something like the following.

```JSON
{"access_token":"ACCESS_TOKEN","token_type":"bearer","expires_in":2592000,"refresh_token":"REFRESH_TOKEN","scope":"read","uid":100101,"info":{"name":"Mark E. Mark","email":"mark@thefunkybunch.com"}}
```

### Access and Refresh Token

* Access token is only issued in the case of the situation where the request process is accordingly terminated by the client.
* The token is utilized to authorize the application when accessing the protected resources. The token represents the extent of accessing rights from the application.
* Refresh token can be used to request a fresh access token from the authorization server. If the token is issued, it may be used to request new access tokens if the original token has expired.

### Grant Type: Implicit

* The implicit grant type is used for mobile apps and web applications where the client secret confidentiality is not guaranteed. The type is designed to give the token to the web browser.
* No refresh token may be issued where it does not authenticate the identity of the application.

### Grant Type: Resource Owner Password Credentials

* The resource owner password credentials grant type, the user provides their service credentials directly to the application. The grant type should only be enabled on the trustable server.
* It should only be used if the application is trusted by the user and the other flows are not feasible to the authorization service.

### Grant Type: Client Credentials

* The client credentials grant type provides an application a way to access its own content.
* The application requests an access token by sending its credentials, its client ID and client secret, to the server.

### Token Usage and Flow

* Once the application has an access token, it may use the token to access the user's account via the API, limited to the scope of access, until the token is expired or is revoked.
* Assuming the access token is valid, the API will process the request according to its API specifications. If the access token is expired or otherwise invalid, the API will return the error.
* If a request token was included when issued, it can be used to request a fresh access token.
